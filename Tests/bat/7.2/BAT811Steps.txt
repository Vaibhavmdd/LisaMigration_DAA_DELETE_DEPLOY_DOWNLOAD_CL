Steps:

Assumption: AMSG 3.1.0 GA build is installed. This is referred as %INSTALL_HOME% directory in this document.

1.Install CPP IT 310 Build(TIB_amxext3cpp_3.1.0_win_x86_vc9.zip) in %INSTALL_HOME%.

Note: Visual studio 2008 is used for CPP IT implementation, hence vc9 build is used. For Visual studio 2005, vc8 is used.

2.Set Environment variable "TIBCOAMX_CPP_CONTAINER_HOME" to <%INSTALL_HOME%>\amx_it_cpp\3.1

3.Install EJBBT 310 Build in %INSTALL_HOME%

4.Start JBOSS 5.0.1 from <%JBOSS_HOME%>\bin\run.bat

5.Add AddressEJB.jar from test case folder(8.11) into <%JBOSS_HOME%>\server\default\deploy 

5.Run TCT from <%INSTALL_HOME%>\tct\1.1

6.Configure Third Party Driver for EJB using JBOSS 5.0.1

7.select client folder for all the jars.

8.select configure.

9.Add Feature "TIBCO enabled EJB Client for JBoss" on QANode1 using
(Infrastructure->Nodes->QANode1->Configurations->Add Feature) in AMX Admin.

10.Click Save and "Apply with Resolve" for that feature.


Configuration required for LINUX (32 bit)

1.set TIBCOAMX_CPP_CONTAINER_HOME variable using following command:
  export TIBCOAMX_CPP_CONTAINER_HOME =<%INSTALL_HOME%>\amx_it_cpp\3.1
  
2.To run same scenario on linux(32 bit) .so file(libBAT811CppProject.so) is provided under 8.11\BAT811CppProject folder.

3.Configuration of Third Party Driver(EJB using JBOSS 5.0.1) and Procedure to enable (TIBCO enabled EJB Client for JBoss) feature on QANode1 are same for windows & linux as explained in step 4 to 10 above.
