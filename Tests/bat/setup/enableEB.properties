########################### Running setup with copying files involved #################################
#If enableEB is set to true, we will copy eb files from sourceFolder to TIBCO_HOME and only copy components/shared/1.0.0/plugins folder to config_home plugin folder 
#the target plugin folder is like D:\\AMX-products\\AMX3x-HFs\\AMX330hf8-GA\\data_hf8\\tibcohost\\Admin-amxadmin-instanceOne\\data_3.2.x\\host\\plugins
#If the replaceJar is set to true, will find the specific JAR file under TIBCO_HOME, replace all the presented  locations.

enableEB=true
replaceJar=false

#This item can support multiple JAR file, It will search all the present JAR under TIBCO_HOME and replace all matched ones.
jarFileList=[com.tibco.tibems.qin_1.0.11.004.jar,];[b,4.0.2]

#This this the folder where eb is unzip to. it should contain components folder at least.
#Also it can contain the JAR file like tibjms.jar , which you need to replace under TIBCO_HOME
#If you want to replace the old jar back to TIBCO_HOME after replacement, make sure the old jar is present at this location, named with tibjms.jar.orig

sourceFolder=/groupfiler/tests/usr/amyguo/EB-Test/eb96/

#This is to identify the whole path of your config_home, if you want to run 3.2.0 or 3.1.2 , the key needs to be updated.
#Which looks like this: D:\\AMX-products\\AMX3x-HFs\\AMX330hf8-GA\\data_hf8\\tibcohost\\Admin-amxadmin-instanceOne\\data_3.2.x\\host\\plugins
hostPlugins=data_3.2.x\\host\\plugins

#To help you double check , you can find the jar under plugins\com.tibco.jms.jmsclient_7.0.1.004
#Matched files is added to cart , file name= D:\AMX-products\AMX3x-HFs\AMX330hf8-GA\components\shared\1.0.0\plugins\com.tibco.jms.jmsclient_7.0.1.004\tibjms.jar
#Matched files is added to cart , file name= D:\AMX-products\AMX3x-HFs\AMX330hf8-GA\data_hf8\tibcohost\Admin-amxadmin-instanceOne\data_3.2.x\host\plugins\com.tibco.jms.jmsclient_7.0.1.004\tibjms.jar

#KnownIssue: If you put tibjms.tar under the sourceFolder, with enableEB=true , this file will also be copied to TIBCO_HOME
#Since the tool will think tibjms.tar is part of EB sources. This will impact nothing. 
#Usually the two flags are not set to true at the same time.
